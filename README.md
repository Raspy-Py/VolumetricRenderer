# Volumetric Renderer

## Overview

The Volumetric Renderer project aims to create an efficient rendering solution using the Vulkan API and C++ for rendering volumetric bodies such as clouds, smoke, and possibly liquids. Our goal is to provide a versatile platform for rendering complex volumetric scenes while ensuring ease of integration and expansion through a user-friendly GUI built with ImGui.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two primary branches:

1. **main**: This branch serves as the foundation for future GUI integration. It includes a GUI skeleton that will be used to seamlessly incorporate my custom renderer. The main branch is perfect for those interested in the complete package of both rendering and user interface.

2. **no-gui**: The 'no-gui' branch focuses on the Vulkan renderer itself. It contains a wealth of useful tools and abstractions tailored for the development of Vulkan applications. This branch is ideal for users who require the rendering capabilities without the GUI components.

## Features

- Efficient Volumetric Rendering with Vulkan API.
- Support for rendering complex volumetric bodies such as clouds, smoke, and liquids.
- A user-friendly GUI built with ImGui, facilitating ease of use and customization.
- Abstractions and tools for Vulkan application development.
- An expandable architecture designed to accommodate future enhancements and additions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Volumetric Renderer project, you can clone the repository and choose the branch that suits your needs:

- For the complete solution with GUI integration: `main`
- For the Vulkan renderer without GUI: `no-gui`

Please refer to the respective branch README files for detailed instructions on building and running the project.
